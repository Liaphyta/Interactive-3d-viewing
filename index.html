 In this lab assignment we are showing different models of shading and illumination.<br /><br />    
 <b>The  available models are shown below
    </b> -  <br /><br/>
    Gouraud/diffuse - Gouraud shading (vertex shading) with diffuse illumination.<br />

    Gouraud/specular - Gouraud shading (vertex shading) with the Phong illumination model to produce a specular highlight.<br />
    
    Phong/diffuse - Phong shading (pixel shading) with diffuse illumination.<br />
    
    Phong/specular - Phong shading (pixel shading) with the Phong illumination model to produce a specular highlight.<br /><br/>

<b>The user should be able to select the active lighting and shading models used by pressing the number keys between:</b><br />
'u' (Gouraud/diffuse)<br />
'i' (Gouraud/specular)<br />
'o' (Phong/diffuse)<br />
'p' (Phong/specular).<br /><br />
The user can interact with the shapes and with the light position.By clicking the 'L' button, the user will activate the movement of light.<br />
By clicking the 'C' button it will activate the camera movement. <br />
<b>Translations (using arrow keys)</b> - <br />
">" (right): move the shape/light/camera to the right <br />
"<" (left): move the shape/light/camera to the left <br />
"/\" (up): move the shape/light/camera up <br />
"\/" (down): move the shape/light/camera down <br />
"," (comma): move the shape/light forward <br />
"." (period): move the shape/light backward <br />
