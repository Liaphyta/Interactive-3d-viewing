# Interactive-3d-viewing

In the application I created nine 3d models(cones) where on each of them is seen the shading and illumination models.In the html file you can see all functionalities that can be done on these objects.As initial shading is used Gouraud with diffuse illumination.

To run the application just run the index file in your web browser.
